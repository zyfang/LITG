##R(Shiny) Questions

1. Doing the tutorial for Shiny, the call runExample("01_hello") gives a web application where we can inspect server.R and ui.R. The call runApp("shiny_practice") (when containing the exact same code) does not give the opportunity to inspect those scripts. Why? Is this a difference in runApp and runExample function, or did I make a mistake in copying/running?
